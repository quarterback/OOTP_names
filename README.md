# Edited Names File for OOTP19
OOTP19 removed the cap on names in the database, so you can't use these files in an older version because the game won't be able to support it. I decided to share my edited names files, because it's a lot of work and I figured someone else would want to use them but wouldn't want to have to exact the effort of adding names galore they might not use.

# July 6th Update: 

These names are all merged from stealofhome's fork of my original files. I've integrated his world.dat file, but removed South Africa (it was my file and it wasn't very good), all of the various us alternate ethnic names, historical british, historical canadian, and removed female names too. 

Here's what's been added to my original file:
- Thai
- Lao
- Ukranian
- Icelandic
- Estonian
- Lithuanian
- French/Dutch/English Caribbean
- Lithuanian
- Cuban
- Central Asian
- North African
- Dominican (Republic)
- Swahili
- Persian
- Belarussian
- Malta
- Faroe Island
- Channel Islands
- Bosnian
- Sing Chinese
- Cambodian
- Mainland Chinese
- Hungarian
- Cambodian
- Nepal
- Bhutan
- Bulgarian
- Sri Lanka
- Slovenian
- Macedonian
- Mongolian
- Latvian

I also balanced the ratios of ethnicities for many of these since many of them are horribly wrong and it annoys me. You can make your own changes to these files to your liking, but this will at least save you lots of time having to do it manually. Or if you end up getting your files overwritten when the game updates, this can save you time. Feel free to fork and share your changes, too.
